## Title: Introduction to ML Workflow and Decision Trees

### Description:
In this assignment, I explored the fundamentals of machine learning using the scikit-learn library, a widely used Python tool. The project focused on decision tree learning for both classification and regression. Working in a group, we completed three compulsory tasks involving the training and evaluation of machine learning models. Additionally, we tackled an advanced task that required implementing a decision tree model for regression to achieve a higher score. Our work was documented in a Jupyter notebook, providing a comprehensive technical report that includes code explanations and answers to assignment questions. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of the ML workflow, decision tree algorithms, and concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
